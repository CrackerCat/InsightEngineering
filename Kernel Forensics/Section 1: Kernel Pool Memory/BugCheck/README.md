# Learning Goals: Understanding the Structure and Mechanics of Kernel-Level Memory Pools

Kernel memory pool operations often surface in crash analysis, making them important concept to understand for debugging.

- Familiarize with common used memory manipulation functions like **`ExAllocatePool2`**, **`ExFreePoolWithTag`**, **`RtlCopyMemory`**, **`RtilFillMemory`**, **`MmAllocateContiguousMemory`**, etc.
- Explore the components of memory pools like pool headers and pool tags.
- Practical lab data with different crashdumps

It's recommended to examine each crash dump analysis, given that different commands and techniques are being used. When you compile and load these drivers, they may trigger a system bugcheck, but keep in mind that the bugcheck codes may vary. With that in mind, it's best to perform all these activities in a lab environment.

# What are the common examples of Memory Corruptions?

Memory corruption can lead to a variety of issues, including crashes. Here are some common examples:

- **Buffer Overflow**: Writing more data to a buffer than it can hold.
- **Use After Free:** Accessing memory after it has been deallocated.
- **Double Free:** Freeing the same memory block twice.
- **Null Pointer Dereference:** Accessing or modifying memory via a null pointer.
- **Stack Corruption:** Overwriting important stack information like return addresses.
- **Uninitialized Memory:** Using memory before it has been initialized.
- **Writing to Read-Only Sections:** Modifying read-only or protected system memory areas.

# What is the Windows Performance Toolkit?

The Windows Performance Toolkit (WPT) is a set of tools provided by Microsoft to analyze and improve the performance of Windows operating systems. These tools help you collect, analyze, and visualize performance data, which can be useful for diagnosing issues, and optimizing both system and application performance. WPT is often used by system administrators, developers, and IT professionals who need to troubleshoot but not limited to performance-related issues on Windows.

# Windows Performance Recorder (WPR)

WPR is a tool used for recording system events and various performance data. It can capture data such as CPU usage, disk I/O, memory usage, and more. Once the recording is done, it saves the data in a file with a **.etl** (Event Trace Log) extension.

# Windows Performance Analyzer (WPA)

WPA is the tool you use to analyze the **.etl** files generated by WPR. It offers a graphical interface that allows you to drill down into performance data to identify performance issues for example. WPA provides various views and graphs that display different aspects of system performance, such as CPU utilization, disk activity, and so on.
